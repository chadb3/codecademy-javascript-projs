To properly identify an <input> we use the <label> element.

The <label> has an opening and closing tag and the displayed.

<form>
<label for="thing"> What is the Thing?</label>
<input type="text" name="the_thing" id=thing>
</form>

The code renders:

What is the Thing?
[               ]

Now users can tell what the input is asking for.

Another benefit for using the <label> element is when this element is clicked, the corresponding <input> is highlighted/selected
