Radio Button:

Used for cases where we want to present multiple optoins but only allow one selection.

Examples:
Agree
or
Disagree

<form>
  <p>What is sum of 12 + 12?</p>
  <input type="radio" id="twentyfour" name="answer" value="24">
  <label for="twentyfour">24</label>
  <br>
  <input type="radio" id="twentyfourtf" name="answer" value="2424">
  <label for="twentyfourtf">24</label>
</form>

like the checkbox it is important to use a label if you want the users to know what they are clicking. 

group them by using the same "name"
