Checkbox:

"multple options to users and allow them the select any number of options"

<label for="item">Item</label>
<input id="item1" name="item" type="checkbox" value="item">

the above will render a checkbox item.

it is important to use labels for checkbox as the "value" is not visible to users.

it is important to share the same "name" for similar checkbox groups.
