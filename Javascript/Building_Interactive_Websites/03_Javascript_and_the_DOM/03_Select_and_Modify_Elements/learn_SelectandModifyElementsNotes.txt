This lesson covers the other DOM elements besides the <body>.
The DOM will allow us to access specific elements

CSS selectors define the elements to which a set of CSS rules apply, but we can also use these same selectors to access DOM elements with Javascript.
	- tag name
	- class
	- ID

Can use the ".querySelector()" to specify a CSS selector as a string. 
It returns the first element that matches the selector. 

For example, document.querySelector('p');, will select the first "paragraph" in the document.

There is also document.getElementById();, to access an element by its ID.

There is also 
document.getElementsByClassName();
document.getElementsByTagName();
	- Both above RETURN an array of elements instead of just one element. 
	- Use "bracket notation "[]" " to access individual elements in the array
	- Note: how both use "getElements" (s added to the end of Element to imply that it returns more than one thing).
	- Example: document.getElementsByClassName("ranking")[1].innerHTML="HTML";
