This lesson deals with the ability to create NEW DOM Elements

to create a paragraph

let paragraph = document.createElement('p');
This will create a new <p></p> (paragraph) element.

and you can assign out things like setting the id, and the innerHTML.

paragraph.id = "newParagraph";
paragraph.innerHTML="Hello Paragraph!";

then to add the "paragraph" to the document

document.body.appendChild(paragraph);
