This lesson deals with basic interactivity (as other interactivity is covered in future lessons).

This will focus on the ".onclick" property

the lesson focuses on creating a function and calling it with the ".onclick".
Of course it doesn't need to use a function, but it is easier to do many things with one click with a function. 

example:

let button_1=document.getElementById("button1");

let changeColor = () =>
{
 button_1.style.backgroundColor='green';
 // debug print
 // console.log("button 1 pressed");
 button_1.style.fontFamily="Comic Sans ms";
} 

button_1.onclick=changeColor;
