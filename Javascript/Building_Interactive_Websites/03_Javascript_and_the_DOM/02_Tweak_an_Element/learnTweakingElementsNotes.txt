When using the DOM, you have access to all that Element's properties.
	- <li>
	- <body>
	- etc...

This includes the ability to modify the contents of the elements as well as its attributes and properties.

Example: document.body.innerHTML = "Hello, World!";
Example 2: document.body.innerHTML="<h1> WOW!</h1>";
