This lesson deals with accessing ".parentNode" and "children"

in the following example there is a unordered list with list items
the ul is called "groceries"
and the li's id is called "must-have"

<ul id='groceries'>
  <li id='must-have'>Toilet Paper</li>
  <li>Apples</li>
  <li>Chocolate</li>
  <li>Dumplings</li>
</ul>

So, "document.getElementById("must-have").parentNode;" will return the <ul>.
And "doucment.getElementById("groceries".children;" will return an array of the lis.

and you can access DOM elements from the children and parentNodes like you would for other ones.

from the examples:

let first = document.querySelector('body').children[0].innerHTML="BROWN BEARS ARE AWESOME!";
// Noted this one as it deals with an array
