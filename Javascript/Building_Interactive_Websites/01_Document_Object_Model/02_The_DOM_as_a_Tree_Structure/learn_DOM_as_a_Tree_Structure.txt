DOM as a Tree Structure

we define a node as an intersecting point in a tree that contains data.

<html>
	<head>
		<title>Title</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>The header</h1>
		<div>
			<p>A description</p>
			<p>A summary</p>
		</div>
	</body>
</html>


Note: wasn't much notes here

key takeaways is that the DOM is a tree like structure
and the above "HTML" is also shown how it looks as A DOM image
