This lesson discusses using an external script file instead of <script>/*writing scripts between here*/</script>
You would link it like you would an external style.css file

<script src="./script.js"></script>

It is said that using a link is preferable because of the programming concept called "Separation of Concerns" (SoC).

This details that you should separate everything you can instead of having everything in the same (messy) file.

This makes the code
1. Easier to read/understand
2. More convenient when changes must be made.

Once again, this lesson focuses on using <script src="link.js"></script>
instead of writing the scripts between <script>console.log("and ;)")</script>
