This Lesson starts with a recap

it says you can put your script between <script> console.log("here");</script>

or you can use an external file <script src="./script.js"></script>

The lesson also covers that items in the <script></script> (including the <script src="..."></script>)

1. They are loaded in the order that they appear. 
2. The html parser does not process the next element in the HTML file until it loads and executes <script></script> element, this will lead to a delay in load times and results in a poor user experience.
3. <scripts> are loaded sequentially
	1. If one script depends on the other - the one with the dependencies should be loaded in first. Then the one that depends on that one. 


The example shows that it should call the "watering can" script before the "flower bloom" script.
(otherwise they would be out of order).

In the hands on part of the lesson,

We were tasked with swapping the order the scripts were loaded in

I had to make it like the following
<script src="script1.js"></script>
<script src="script2.js"></script>

This is because in script1 there is a new variable "newColor" created that stores the updated font color.

Then in script 2 "elem.style.color = newColor;" the color gets set based off that value

It would throw an error in the console otherwise (Or some unintentional behavior)
