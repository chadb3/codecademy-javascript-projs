Matching a Pattern:

use a pattern attrubute and use regex to check input.

Example:

<input id="payment" name="payment" type="text" required pattern="[0-9]{14,16}">

This checks if the input is numbers and it is between 14 and 16 characters long.

Note: this uses regex/Regular Expression to "match the pattern"

Note: Validation warning could be covered by "View Saved Login" button but it is there when it shows up...
In other words if that "View Saved Login" button appears then it is probably trying to warn you about characters or not matching the pattern.
