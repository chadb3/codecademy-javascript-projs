Set a Minimum and Maximum:

<input type="number"> and <input type="range">

<form action="/example.html" method="POST">
  <label for="guests">Enter # of guests:</label>
  <input id="guests" name="guests" type="number" min="1" max="4">
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>

if the user is not in the range, they get a warning.

using the updown, it won't even let you go outside the range.
