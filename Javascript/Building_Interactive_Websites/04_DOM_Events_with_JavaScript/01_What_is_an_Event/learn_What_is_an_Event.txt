This lesson deals with
with clicking on things

These are called events.
 - a mouse clicking on a button
 - webpages files loading in a browser 
 - a user interacting with an image

when a user does any of the above, they are causing an event to be fired. 

Overall this deals with when a user clicks on something intractable, it causes an event to be fired.

this is a basic lesson with no work other than observing the intractability on the example webpage.
