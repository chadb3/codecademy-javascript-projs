Events are stored as objects

This covers that there are properties associated with event objects.

- .target - ref to what it is registered to
- .type - name of the event
- .timestamp - number of milliseconds that passed since the document loaded and the event triggered. 

so what they mean is

function asdf(event){
 console.log(event.timestamp);
}

one can call event.(property) above

thisTarget.addEventListener('click',asdf);
