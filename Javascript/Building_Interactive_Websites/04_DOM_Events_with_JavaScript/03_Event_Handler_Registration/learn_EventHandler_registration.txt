This lesson starts off with

.addEventListener()

method.

using .addEventListener() we can have the DOM element listen for a specific event and execute a block of code when it detects the event. 

Event Target = the DOM element that is listening for an event

we can use it like the following example

let eventTarget=document.getElementById('target');
	- used to get the target
eventTarget.addEventListener('click',function())
{
 // Code will run here

}
	- addEventListener takes 2 args
		- Event_Name : String
		- Event_Handler : Function
	
	- Click = the event
		- fires when "eventTarget" is clicked

	- The "{Code Block}" will execute when the click event is detected

!Gotcha Alert!

It's best practice to create a named event handler function.
Code will remain organized and reusable this way, even if the code gets very complex.

Example:

function eventHandlerFunction(){
 // code goes here
}

eventTarget.addEventListner('click',eventHandlerFunction);

this is better than defining an anonymous functions within the method.

// end
