This lesson shows a "Pavlovian" Analogy to describe how Events are triggered, detected, and handled. 

The lesson describes how the ringing of a bell is like an event firing. 
the dog hears this bell and the dog starts to dog out as it knows it is dinner time, is like the event being detected. 
the dog gets its food, and eats is like the event being handled. 

so an example of firing events in the DOM:

User clicks on a "button" this button calls a function that changes something on the page. 

button->function->"something happens"
