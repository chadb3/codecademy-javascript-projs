The lesson starts off with there is another way to do event handlers besides ".addEventListener()"

There is also an ".onevent" property
the pattern is: ".on" followed by lowercased type name

example:

eventTarget.onclick = myEventHandlerFunction;

 - eventTarget is given the ".onclick" property and its value = myEventHandlerFunction

Important:

".onevent" property and ".addEventListener()" will both register event listiners

With the ".onevent" only one event handler function can be attached to the event target. 

".addEventListener()" can handle multiple event handler functions
