Runtime Error Notes. 

The lecture starts off with showing the anatomy of an error

Error Location: /mydir/main.js:1
Filename:main.js
Line Number: ":1"

Error Name: ReferenceError:
Error Message: myVar is not defined

"ReferenceError: myVar is not defined.

the code that threw the error: myVar; ("myVar;")

In JavaScript there are built-in error objects that have a "name" and "message" property which tell us what went wrong. 

some error examples:

ReferenceError: when a variable or function cannot be found. (doing something like above ("newVar;").

TypeError: when a value is not a valid type. (trying to reassign a const variable)
