Constructing an Error Notes:

JavaScript errors are objects that have a name and message property. 

The "Error" function allows for custom error messages.

console.log(Error("Example Error"));

The Error function takes an argument of a string which becomes the value of the errorâ€™s message property. 

console.log(new Error("Example Error"));

you might see errors created like "new Error(...)"

both will have the same functionality.

"Keep in mind that creating an error is not the same as throwing an error. A thrown error will cause the program to stop running. We cover how to throw our created errors in the next exercise! "

I included the above as in my examples using "console.log(Error("Example Error"))"

will create an error in the console but the program will still run and not crash.

example output of created error:

Error: Example Error
