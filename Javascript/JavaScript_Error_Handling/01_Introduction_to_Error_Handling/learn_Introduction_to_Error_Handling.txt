Introduction to Error Handling notes.

This lesson was "lecture only" and below I will try to note items that could appear on the quiz. 

Error handling is the process of programmatically anticipating and addressing errors. 

In JavaScript we handle errors using the keywords
"try"
"catch"

We "try" something that can potentially throw an error. And we "catch" the error if one occurs.
