Constructor

The lesson starts with a note that there are similarities between Objects and Classes

The noted exception

Classes have Constructors

Example:

Class Dog{
 constructor(name_in){
  this.name=name_in;
  this.behavior =0;
}
}

Dog = name of class
JavaScript will invoke the constructor every time we create a new instance of  our Dog class.

Constructor accepts one argument called "name_in"

we use the "this." refers to the variable that is an instance of the class. 
this.name=name_in; (the class stores a value name that is equal to the arg name_in).

behavior tracks a different variable that will be changed later. Note that it wasn't an argument in the constructor.
