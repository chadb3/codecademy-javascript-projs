Inheritance IV (4)

This lesson is the continuing the previous lessons and reiterate the following.

When we call extends in a class declaration, all of the parent methods are available to the child class. 

in this lesson we will call the members that are defined in the parent class from a child class members and investigate the behavior.

 As I have some coding experience. I will use an example here. Please refer to the lesson to review.
