class Surgeon{
constructor(name,department){
 this.name=name;
 this.department=department;
}

}

- const doc=new Surgeon("Dr. Cutter", "Cutting Department");
console.log(doc.name);

- Created a new variable named doc that will store an instance of our Surgeon Class

- Used the "new" keyword to generate a new instance of the Surgeon class. The "new" keyword calls the constructor(), runs the code inside of it, and returns the new isntance. 

- Passed in "Dr. Cutter" which sets the name property to "Dr. Cutter", and "Cutting Department" which sets the department property to "Cutting Department" 

Finally we log the value name key in our doc object, which logs "Dr. Cutter" to the console.
