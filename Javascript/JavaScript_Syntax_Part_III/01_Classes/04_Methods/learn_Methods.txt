Methods

Methods are functions that are members of a class that can be called after the function is declared. (Note: there are static methods that don't need a declaration and can be called but we haven't got that far yet..)

Note: Class method and getter syntax is the same as it is for objects except you can not include commas between methods.

The above was bolded so I think it will appear on the test.

Example:

class Dog {
  constructor(name) {
    this._name = name;
    this._behavior = 0;
  }
    
  get name() {
    return this._name;
  }
  
  get behavior() {
    return this._behavior;
  }
  
  incrementBehavior() {
    this._behavior++;
  }
}

Note the getter and setter. Also notice the lack of commas between each method.

notice the use of underscores "_" "which indicates that these properties should not be accessed directly."
