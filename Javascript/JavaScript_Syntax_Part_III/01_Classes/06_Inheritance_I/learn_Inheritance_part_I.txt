Inheritance I

This is a text only lesson with no exercise (unless you try the example...)

it has to do with creating a parent class from that can then have child cases that share properties of the parent, but have their own too.

Notes: When multiple classes share properties or methods, they become candidates for inheritance â€” a tool developers use to decrease the amount of code they need to write. 

With inheritance, you can create a parent class (also known as a superclass) with properties and methods that multiple child classes (also known as subclasses) share. The child classes inherit the properties and methods from their parent class. 

(I couldn't find a way to creatively reword the above as it appears it is a definition, and will be on the test...).
