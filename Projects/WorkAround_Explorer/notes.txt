Note: if you are doing this locally, then you may get the following errors "(Reason: CORS request not http)." (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS/Errors/CORSRequestNotHttp)

To resolve you may need to host a local server

python3 -m http.server

You can use the above using python3. I didn't need to install anything for it to work (using Ubuntu 23.04 on a virtual machine).

Steps to get it to work:
 1. fire up your terminal or powershell
 2. Navigate to your working directory (this one for example).
 3. Simply run "python3 -m http.server"
 4. Finally, go to "http://localhost:8000/"

This resolved the issue for me where Task 4 wasn't working despite it telling me it should. 

Further note. I tend to do my work locally as I can't stand it when codecademy loses connection to my work. I have lost work before, and I loses that short time it is waiting to reconnect. 

If you use codecademy and don't do anything locally then you won't have any issues.
